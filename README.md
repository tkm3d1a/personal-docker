# Personal Docker Repo

This will be a collection of Docker files and docker-compose files that I use/play with as I go through setting up and learning new technologies.  This will be maintained by myself as I build and any finished files will be merged into the main branch.  Each file will be structured such that a readme will be used to describe each files purpose and any special use instructions.

## List of files

*none*

## List of WIP

- Adminer+mySQL
  - branch-> phpmyadmin+mysql (I know...)
  - first test successful, ran and stood up
  - only using latest version tags for now
  - volume persitence working
  - test tables/db created

## List of potential work

- PHPMyadmin + MaraiDB
  - Plan to be a basic no frills set up to make a consistent local env accessible maraiDB image
  - should only be used for local dev and a way to have a consistent MaraiDB instance without needing to do bash scripts for starting/stopping the server
  - Should start as an empty image, no backups to load
- MERN Stack deployment
  - This will just be a copy of the MERN project that was completed by myself
  - Will trim out some of the existing info and just setup the basic connection
  - Minimal code to be added, just plan on creating the relevant docker and docker compose files for
  - **Might scrap once investigating**
